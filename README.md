# Rhino
This consists of a module, rhino.py which is made up of classes and methods
which keep track of the rhinos (an extinct mammal) in a wildlife park in Kenya.

#Rhinotester

This is a script which contains tests several test cases which test the
class in the file rhino.py

#what to know

In order to see what happens with my files, you must download both files
Remember to save both in the same directory
Run the file, rhinotester.py from the commandline. I recommend running from the commandline because it's what i have
come to like, but if you don't like to work from the commandline, then please you can try copying the code into an editor like
VS code and run it on there. Either way, you should get the same results.

If you encounter problems with the code or would like to give me any advice or even just talk about anything, 
you can reach me on the following:
